# A simple CD Player project - Turbo Pascal - MS-Dos - 1995

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

An audio CD player for MS-Dos developed in [Turbo Pascal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) and a Delphi 1 version from the same period.

This project was undoubtedly a test, and was not deployed. You'll find the 8-bit binaries for MS-Dos in the “release” subfolder.

It's possible that it is compilable with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) but I haven't tried. Units not supplied can be found in the [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal) repository. If any are missing, please let me know so that I can add them.
